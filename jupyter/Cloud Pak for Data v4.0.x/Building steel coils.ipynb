There is no limitation in the number of slabs that can be requested, but only a finite number of slab sizes are available (sizes 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 34, 40, 43, 45). \n* The problem is to select a number of slabs to build the coil orders, and to satisfy the following constraints:\n    * A coil order can be built from only one slab.\n    * Each coil order requires a specific process to build it from a slab. This process is encoded by a color.\n    * Several coil orders can be built from the same slab. But a slab can be used to produce at most two different \"colors\" of coils.\n    * The sum of the sizes of each coil order built from a slab must not exceed the slab size.\n\n\n* Finally, the production plan should minimize the unused capacity of the selected slabs.\n\n\n* This problem is based on **prob038: Steel mill slab design problem** from <a href=\"http://www.csplib.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">CSPLib</a>. It is a simplification of an industrial problem described in J. R. Kalagnanam, M. W. Dawande, M. Trumbo, H. S. Lee. \"Inventory Matching Problems in the Steel Industry,\" IBM Research Report RC 21171, 1998.\n\n* Please refer to documentation for appropriate setup of solving configuration.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "*****\n## How  decision optimization can help\n* Prescriptive analytics technology recommends actions based on desired outcomes, taking into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. This insight can help your organization make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n<br/>\n\n+ For example:\n    + Automate complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage limited resources.\n    + Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n    + Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n    + Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Use decision optimization", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Step 1: Model the data", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from docplex.cp.model import *", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "Set model parameter", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from collections import namedtuple\n\n##############################################################################\n# Model configuration\n##############################################################################\n\n# The number of coils to produce\nTUPLE_ORDER = namedtuple(\"TUPLE_ORDER\", [\"index\", \"weight\", \"color\"])\norders = [ TUPLE_ORDER(1, 22, 5),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(2,  9, 3),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(3,  9, 4),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(4,  8, 5),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(5,  8, 7),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(6,  6, 3),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(7,  5, 6),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(8,  3, 0),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(9,  3, 2),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(10, 3, 3),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(11, 2, 1),\n           TUPLE_ORDER(12, 2, 5)\n           ]\n\nNB_SLABS = 12\nMAX_COLOR_PER_SLAB = 2\n\n# The total number of slabs available.
