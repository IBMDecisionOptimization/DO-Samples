It takes into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. With this insight, your organization can make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n<br/>\n\n<u>With prescriptive analytics, you can:</u> \n\n* Automate the complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage your limited resources.\n* Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n* Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n* Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Use decision optimization", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Step 1: Model the data", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "products = [(\"kluski\", 100, 0.6, 0.8),\n            (\"capellini\", 200, 0.8, 0.9),\n            (\"fettucine\", 300, 0.3, 0.4)]\n\n# resources are a list of simple tuples (name, capacity)\nresources = [(\"flour\", 20),\n             (\"eggs\", 40)]\n\nconsumptions = {(\"kluski\", \"flour\"): 0.5,\n                (\"kluski\", \"eggs\"): 0.2,\n                (\"capellini\", \"flour\"): 0.4,\n                (\"capellini\", \"eggs\"): 0.4,\n                (\"fettucine\", \"flour\"): 0.3,\n                (\"fettucine\", \"eggs\"): 0.6}", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "### Step 2: Prepare the data\n\nThe data used is very simple and is ready to use without any cleaning, massage, refactoring.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Step 3: Set up the prescriptive model\n\nSet up the prescriptive model using the Mathematical Programming (docplex.mp) modeling package.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from docplex.mp.environment import Environment\nenv = Environment()\nenv.print_information()", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "#### Create the DOcplex model\nThe model contains all the business constraints and defines the objective.\n\nWe now use CPLEX Modeling for Python to build a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model for this problem.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "from docplex.mp.model import Model\nmdl = Model(name=\"pasta\")", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "#### Define the decision variables", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "inside_vars = mdl.continuous_var_dict(products, name='inside')\noutside_vars = mdl.continuous_var_dict(products, name='outside')", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "#### Express the business constraints\n\n   * Each product can be produced either inside the company or outside, at a higher cost.\n   * The inside production is constrained by the company's resources, while outside production is considered unlimited.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "# --- constraints ---\n# demand satisfaction\nmdl.add_constraints((inside_vars[prod] + outside_vars[prod] >= prod[1], 'ct_demand_%s' % prod[0]) for prod in products)\n\n# --- resource capacity ---\nmdl.add_constraints((mdl.sum(inside_vars[p] * consumptions[p[0], res[0]] for p in products) <= res[1], 'ct_res_%s' % res[0]) for res in resources)\n\nmdl.print_information()", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {"scrolled": true}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "#### Express the objective\n\nMinimizing the production cost for a number of products while satisfying customer demand.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "total_inside_cost = mdl.sum(inside_vars[p] * p[2] for p in products)\ntotal_outside_cost = mdl.sum(outside_vars[p] * p[3] for p in products)\n\nmdl.minimize(total_inside_cost + total_outside_cost)", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "#### Solve with Decision Optimization\n\nNow solve the model, using `Model.solve()`.
