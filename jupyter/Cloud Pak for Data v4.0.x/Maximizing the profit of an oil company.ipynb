Each type of gasoline is produced by blending different types of crude oils that must be purchased. The company must decide how much crude oil to buy in order to maximize its profit while respecting processing capacities and quality levels as well as satisfying customer demand.\n\n* Blending problems are a typical industry application of Linear Programming (LP). LP represents real life problems mathematically using an objective function to represent the goal that is to be minimized or maximized, together with a set of linear constraints which define the conditions to be satisfied and the limitations of the real life problem. The function and constraints are expressed in terms of decision variables and the solution, obtained from optimization engines such as IBM\u00ae ILOG\u00ae CPLEX\u00ae, provides the best values for these variables so that the objective function is optimized.\n\n* The oil-blending problem consists of calculating different blends of gasoline according to specific quality criteria.\n\n* Three types of gasoline are manufactured: super, regular, and diesel. \n\n* Each type of gasoline is produced by blending three types of crude oil: crude1, crude2, and crude3. \n\n* The gasoline must satisfy some quality criteria with respect to their lead content and their octane ratings, thus constraining the possible blendings.\n\n* The company must also satisfy its customer demand, which is 3,000 barrels a day of super, 2,000 of regular, and 1,000 of diesel. \n\n* The company can purchase 5,000 barrels of each type of crude oil per day and can process at most 14,000 barrels a day.\n\n* In addition, the company has the option of advertising a gasoline, in which case the demand for this type of gasoline increases by ten barrels for every dollar spent. \n\n* Finally, it costs four dollars to transform a barrel of oil into a barrel of gasoline.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## How Decision Optimization can help\n* Prescriptive analytics technology recommends actions based on desired outcomes, taking into account specific scenarios, resources, and knowledge of past and current events. This insight can help your organization make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n<br/>\n\n+ For example:\n    + Automate complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage limited resources.\n    + Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n    + Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n    + Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Use Decision Optimization", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Step 1: Model the data\n\n* For each type of crude oil, there are capacities of what can be bought, the buying price, the octane level, and the lead level. \n* For each type of gasoline or diesel, there is customer demand, selling prices, and octane and lead levels.\n* There is a maximum level of production imposed by the factory's limit as well as a fixed production cost. \n* There are inventory costs for each type of final product and blending proportions.
