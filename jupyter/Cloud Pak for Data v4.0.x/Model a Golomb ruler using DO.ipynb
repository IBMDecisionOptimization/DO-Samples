The number of marks on the ruler is its order, and the largest distance between two of its marks is its length. \n\nFollowing is an example of Golomb ruler of order 4 and length 6.\n<center><img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/05/Golomb_Ruler-4.svg/220px-Golomb_Ruler-4.svg.png\"></center>\n<p>\nThis problem is not only an intellectual problem.

This insight can help your organization make better decisions and have greater control of business outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics is the next step on the path to insight-based actions. It creates value through synergy with predictive analytics, which analyzes data to predict future outcomes.  \n\n* Prescriptive analytics takes that insight to the next level by suggesting the optimal way to handle that future situation. Organizations that can act fast in dynamic conditions and make superior decisions in uncertain environments gain a strong competitive advantage.  \n<br/>\n\n+ For example:\n    + Automate complex decisions and trade-offs to better manage limited resources.\n    + Take advantage of a future opportunity or mitigate a future risk.\n    + Proactively update recommendations based on changing events.\n    + Meet operational goals, increase customer loyalty, prevent threats and fraud, and optimize business processes.\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<h3>Modeling the problem</h3>\n<p>\nConstraint Programming is a programming paradigm that allows to express a problem using:\n\n* the unknowns of the problem (the <i>variables</i>),\n* the constraints/laws/rules of the problem, mathematical expressions linking variables together (the <i>constraints</i>),\n* what is to be optimized (the <i>objective function</i>).\n\n<p>\nAll this information, plus some configuration parameters, is aggregated into a single object called <i>model</i>. \n<p>\nThe remainder of this notebook describes in details how to build and solve this problem with IBM CP Optimizer, using its <i>DOcplex</i> Python modeling API.", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "## Use decision optimization", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "### Step 1: Model the data\n", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "# Import Constraint Programming modelization functions\nfrom docplex.cp.model import CpoModel", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "<h4>Define model input data</h4>\n<p>\nThe first thing to define is the model input data.\nIn the case of the Golomb Ruler problem, there is only one input which is the order of the ruler, that is the number of marks:", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "# Define required number of marks on the ruler\nORDER = 7", "cell_type": "code", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "execution_count": null}, {"source": "### Step 2: Set up the prescriptive model", "cell_type": "markdown", "metadata": {}}, {"source": "<h4>Create the model container</h4>\n<p>\nThe model is represented by a Python object that is filled with the different model elements (variables, constraints, objective function, etc).

To reduce the search space, it is important to reduce this domain as far as possible.\n\n* In our case, we can naively estimate that the maximum distance between two adjacent marks is the order of the ruler minus one. Then the maximal position of a mark is (ORDER - 1)\u00b2. Each variable domain is then limited to an interval [0..(ORDER - 1)\u00b2].\n\n* A list of integer variables can be defined using method <i>integer_var_list()</i>.
